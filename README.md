ChromiumWebView
================

Android WebView wrapper based on chromium

## Why you need

The current performance of Android webview is so poor. ChromiumWebView gives your 
application early access to the newest features in Chromium, and removes the
variability due to different WebView implementations in different versions of
Android.

Inspired by [ChromeView project](https://github.com/pwnall/chromeview), our 
goal is to provide full Android WebKit compatible API, so the web apps or 
hybrid apps can easily immigrate to chromium. 

## Setting Up

This section explains how to set up your Android project to use ChromiumWebView.

### Get the Code

Check out the repository in your Eclipse workspace, and make your project use 
ChromiumWebView as a library. In Eclipse, right-click your project directory, 
select `Properties`, choose the `Android` category, and click on the `Add` button 
in the `Library` section.

### Copy Data

Copy `assets/webviewchromium.pak` to your project's `assets` directory. [Star 
this bug](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=35748) if you 
agree that this is annoying.

### Initialize

In your Application subclass, call ChromeIntializer.initialize and pass it the 
application's context. For example,

```java
import com.mogoweb.chrome.ChromeInitializer;
import android.app.Application;

public class MyApplication extends Application {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        ChromeInitializer.initialize(this);
    }
}
```

Now you can use ChromiumWebView as the same as Android WebView except for different
package name.

### TestShell

There is a sample project to illustrate the usage of ChromiumWebView
in the test folder. It is only a shell program that can navigate website.
